# sign_np
Tool to encrypt and sign PSP ISO images into PSN PBP files. Written by **Hykem**.

This tool allows you to encrypt and sign a PSP ISO image into a PSN EBOOT.PBP file, as well as encrypt and sign a BOOT.BIN file into a valid EBOOT.BIN.
The generated files are fully compatible with PSP's official firmwares, thus allowing for real signed homebrew to be run.
